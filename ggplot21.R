#Here is an example of how you might create a violin plot in R of soil sample concentration data using ggplot2 for multiple chemicals grouped by exposure area and sample depth:
  
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)

# Create example data
data1 <- data.frame(
  Chemical = rep(paste0("Chemical ", 1:4), each = 9),
  ExposureArea = rep(paste0("Area ", 1:3), 12),
  Depth1 = runif(36, 10, 60),
  Depth2 = runif(36, 15, 65),
  Depth3 = runif(36, 20, 70)
)

# Reshape data from wide to long format
data_long1 <- pivot_longer(data1,
                          cols = starts_with("Depth"),
                          names_to = 'Depth',
                          values_to = 'Concentration')

# Create plot
ggplot(data_long1,aes(x=Chemical,y=Concentration)) +
  geom_violin() +
  facet_grid(Depth ~ ExposureArea) +
  labs(title="Soil Sample Concentration Data",
       #x="Chemical",
       y="Concentration")

#This code creates a violin plot using ggplot2 with the x-axis representing the exposure area and the y-axis representing the concentration. The plot is faceted by depth and chemical.
