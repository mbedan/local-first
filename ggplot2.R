# Here is an example of how you might create a violin plot in R of soil sample concentration data using ggplot2 for multiple chemicals grouped by exposure area and sample depth:
# This code creates a violin plot using ggplot2 with the x-axis representing the exposure area and the y-axis representing the concentration. The plot is faceted by depth and chemical.
    
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)

# Create example data
data <- data.frame(
  Chemical = rep(paste0("Chemical ", 1:9), each = 9),
  ExposureArea = rep(paste0("Area ", 1:3), 27),
  SurfaceSoil = runif(81, 10, 60),
  TotalSoil = runif(81, 15, 65),
  DeepSoil = runif(81, 20, 70)
)

# Reshape data from wide to long format
data_long <- pivot_longer(data,
                          cols = c("SurfaceSoil", "TotalSoil", "DeepSoil"),
                          names_to = 'Depth',
                          values_to = 'Concentration')

# Create plot
ggplot(data_long,aes(x=ExposureArea,y=Concentration)) +
  geom_violin() +
  facet_grid(Depth ~ Chemical) +
  labs(title="Soil Sample Concentration Data",
       x="Exposure Area",
       y="Concentration")
